Todo Planner (Vanilla JavaScript)

A clean, lightweight todo planner built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. This web application features daily/weekly/monthly organization, persistent storage, and a polished user experience

This project was built to practice and familiarize myself with state-driven UI, DOM manipulation, as well as real-word frontend patterns without using a framework. 

Features:
- Add todos with a Daily / Weekly / Monthly timeframe
- Filter todos using tabs (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, All)
- Mark todos as done / undone
- Delete todos
- Persistent storage using localStorage
- Live task counts per tab
